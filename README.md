# ChatJeepTea

ChatJeepTea is a Telegram chat bot that uses OpenAI's API, Whisper, and Google text-to-speech to enable voice-based conversations in near-realtime. It is written in Python.

## Getting Started

To use ChatJeepTea, you will need to set the following environment variables:
- `TOKEN` for your Telegram bot token
- `OPENAI` for your OpenAI API key

Please also save your google cloud credentials in `src/key.json`.

Since these APIs cost money, add the user ids in a list in `src/auth.json`.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
1. `python3 -m venv .venv`
1. `. .venv/bin/activate`
1. Install dependencies with `pip3 install -r src/requirements.txt`
1. Set environment variables (or even better, use direnv)
1. Run `python3 main.py`

### Usage

To chat with ChatJeepTea, simply add the bot to a Telegram chat and send messages as usual. The bot will respond to your messages with voice messages generated by Google text-to-speech. 

Note: group chats are not currently supported.
