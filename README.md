# ChatJeepTea

ChatJeepTea is a Telegram chat bot that uses OpenAI's API and Whisper to enable voice-based conversations in near-realtime. It is written in Python.

## Getting Started

To use ChatJeepTea, you will need to set the following environment variables:
- `TOKEN` for your Telegram bot token
- `OPENAI` for your OpenAI API key

`src/auth.json` gets auto-populated with the first telegram user id that uses the bot. That's because these are paying APIs, and telegram bots are public. If you want to grant other users the ability to use the bot, then add their telegram user ids to this file too.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
1. `python3 -m venv .venv`
1. `. .venv/bin/activate`
1. Install dependencies with `pip3 install -r src/requirements.txt`
1. Set environment variables (or even better, use direnv)
1. Run `python3 src/main.py`

### Usage

To chat with ChatJeepTea, simply add the bot to a Telegram chat and send messages as usual. The bot will respond to your messages with voice messages generated by Google text-to-speech. 

Note: group chats are not currently supported.
